* Added a wt.rb file that is installed and will pull in either 'wthttp' or the
'wtfcgi' extensions according to the value of the 'WT_ENV' environment variable
* Add '#!/usr/bin/ruby' to the example program sources

* Instead of a single 'wt' ruby extension linked against libwthttp, build two
ruby extensions 'wthttp' and 'wtfcgi' linked against the http and fcgi 
connectors respectively. 
* Wt::Ruby programs, such as the examples, could still have require 'wt' 
statements, and they could be set up to actually pull in either the 'wthttp'
or 'wtfcgi' extension according to whether they are to be used in a 
development or production environment. For instance, in wt.rb:

    if ENV['WT_ENV'] == 'production'
      require 'wtfcgi'
    elsif ENV['WT_ENV'] == 'development'
      require 'wthttp'
    end

* Removed redundant copies of the Ext javascript code in the examples

* Stateless slots cannot have any arguments, however they can be connected to
signals which have arguments. So when an EventSignal is connected to a slot
with arity zero then check for whether the slot is stateless.
* Fixed some bugs in the treelist example.

* Added an ancestors() method for the Wt:: classes
* Rename classnameMap as IdToClassNameMap to be consistent with QtRuby

2008-12-23 Richard Dale <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Added an implementation of stateless slots. Example usage:

    implementStateless(:showIcon1, :undoShowIcon1)

* When the construct_copy() function was used to copy an instance, it wasn't
initializing the binding for the new instance. This caused a crash when the
destructor for the instance tried to make a callback with the null binding. 
* Added a std::vector<Wt::WStandardItem*> marshaller
* If a set method setXXX() already existed for an instance variable XXX, then
the type of the variable wasn't being registered, and smoke code generation 
failed

2008-12-18 Richard Dale <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Added Ruby 1.9 compatible RSTRING handling
* Update the wt_header_list with the Wt 2.2.2 headers and tweak the smoke lib
code generation for the smoke lib to work
* However, the Wt::WPopupMenu header is missing a Wt/WApplication include

2008-12-14 Richard Dale <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Added Wt::WModelIndex.internalPointer() and 
Wt::WAbstractItemModel.createIndex() methods

2008-12-12 Richard Dale <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Updated the smoke.h header with improved binary chop code
