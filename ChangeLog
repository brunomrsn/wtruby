* When a WServer method raises a C++ exception, convert it to a Ruby runtime
error calling rb_raise()

2009-01-18 Richard Dale <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Added a Wt::wt_version to return the version string of the Wt lib being used
* Raise the version string of Wt::Ruby to 0.9.0
* The Wt::WServer.setEntryPoint() method that can be passed a Ruby block
like this:

    server.addEntryPoint(Wt::WServer::Application) do |env|
      HelloApplication.new(env, false)
    end

Some more work needs to be done to translate C++ exceptions to Ruby ones for
the WServer methods
* Added the hello-widgetset example
* Added WTHTTP_CONFIGURATION, RUNDIR and WT_CONFIG_XML top level constants
corresponding to the ones in the WConfig.h header
* Don't repeat the code to convert from ARGV to argc/argv and add a utility
function args2argv()
* Added patch from Koen Deforche to fix a looping on startup problem. Thanks
for the patch, but I'm not sure why only certain users are affected.
* Added the treeview example

2009-01-16 Richard Dale <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Removed the simplechat example as it only works with the multi-threaded 
version of libwthttp, which can't be used with Wt::Ruby

2009-01-15 Richard Dale <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Allow Ruby Date and Time instances to be passed to the Wt::WDate and 
Boost::Any constructors
* Remove the optimization in the mark function to only traverse the tree of 
children of WObjects which don't have parents and always traverse instead.

2009-01-11 Richard Dale <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Added a wt.rb file that is installed and will pull in either 'wthttp' or the
'wtfcgi' extensions according to the value of the 'WT_ENV' environment variable
* Add '#!/usr/bin/ruby' to the example program sources

2008-12-28 Richard Dale <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Instead of a single 'wt' ruby extension linked against libwthttp, build two
ruby extensions 'wthttp' and 'wtfcgi' linked against the http and fcgi 
connectors respectively. 
* Wt::Ruby programs, such as the examples, could still have require 'wt' 
statements, and they could be set up to actually pull in either the 'wthttp'
or 'wtfcgi' extension according to whether they are to be used in a 
development or production environment. For instance, in wt.rb:

    if ENV['WT_ENV'] == 'production'
      require 'wtfcgi'
    elsif ENV['WT_ENV'] == 'development'
      require 'wthttp'
    end

* Removed redundant copies of the Ext javascript code in the examples

* Stateless slots cannot have any arguments, however they can be connected to
signals which have arguments. So when an EventSignal is connected to a slot
with arity zero then check for whether the slot is stateless.
* Fixed some bugs in the treelist example.

2008-12-24 Richard Dale <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Added an ancestors() method for the Wt:: classes
* Rename classnameMap as IdToClassNameMap to be consistent with QtRuby

2008-12-23 Richard Dale <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Added an implementation of stateless slots. Example usage:

    implementStateless(:showIcon1, :undoShowIcon1)

2008-12-19 Richard Dale <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* When the construct_copy() function was used to copy an instance, it wasn't
initializing the binding for the new instance. This caused a crash when the
destructor for the instance tried to make a callback with the null binding. 
* Added a std::vector<Wt::WStandardItem*> marshaller
* If a set method setXXX() already existed for an instance variable XXX, then
the type of the variable wasn't being registered, and smoke code generation 
failed

2008-12-18 Richard Dale <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Added Ruby 1.9 compatible RSTRING handling
* Update the wt_header_list with the Wt 2.2.2 headers and tweak the smoke lib
code generation for the smoke lib to work
* However, the Wt::WPopupMenu header is missing a Wt/WApplication include

2008-12-14 Richard Dale <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Added Wt::WModelIndex.internalPointer() and 
Wt::WAbstractItemModel.createIndex() methods

2008-12-12 Richard Dale <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Updated the smoke.h header with improved binary chop code
