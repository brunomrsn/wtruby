* When the construct_copy() function was used to copy an instance, it wasn't
initializing the binding for the new instance. This caused a crash when the
destructor for the instance tried to make a callback withthe null binding. 
* Added a std::vector<Wt::WStandardItem*> marshaller

* Update the wt_header_list with the Wt 2.2.2 headers and tweak the smoke lib
