<h2><span>Wt Chat client</span></h2>

<p>This is a simple multi-user chat client and server.</p>

<p>For simplicity, server and client all run in the same process, and
therefore it is ideal for a deployment using wthttpd, when running all
clients in the same process. (Because all I/O is asynchroneous, this
probably could easily support thousands of simultaneous users as
well).</p>

<p>The client is contained in a widget (SimpleChatWidget), and can be
instantiated as many times as you like, even in the same
application. <br />

Because of the widget abstraction, it is straight forward to include a
chat client in your own application, by linking both the client and
server classes into your application.</p>

<p>The implementation uses server-initiated updates, a feature that is
still under development in Wt. When a message is received, the user
interface (i.e. widget tree) not only of the current session, but also
of all other clients is updated simultaneously, as part of handling
the event.</p>
